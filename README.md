## Overview

This project provides code for generating figures (2 - 11) in the paper [Transfer Operators from Batches of Unpaired Points via Entropic Transport Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08425)

## Getting started
* The code to generate simulated data for corresponding figures are given with the file name "Data_.ipynb/.py". We also provide the already-generated data in "Data_.csv" to save your time.
* [kernel_example.ipynb](./kernel_example.ipynb) is for generating figure 2 and the kernel density plots in figure 3,4,5.
* [plot_line_345.ipynb](./plot_line_345.ipynb) is for generating the line plots in figure 3,4,5.
* [plot_6.ipynb](./plot_6.ipynb) and [plot_7.ipynb](./plot_7.ipynb) are for generating figure 6 and 7 correspondingly.
