## Overview

This project provides code for generating figures (2 - 11) in the paper [Transfer Operators from Batches of Unpaired Points via Entropic Transport Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08425)

## Getting started
* [Data_345.ipynb](./Data_345.ipynb) and [Data_6.py](./Data_6.py) are used to generate simulated data for the corresponding plots. To save your time, we also provide ready-to-use data: [Data_3.csv](./Data_3.csv), [Data_4.csv](./Data_4.csv), [Data_5.csv](./Data_5.csv), [Data_6.csv](./Data_6.csv).
* [kernel_example.ipynb](./kernel_example.ipynb) is for generating figure 2 and the kernel density plots in figure 3,4,5.
* [plot_line_345.ipynb](./plot_line_345.ipynb) is for generating the line plots in figure 3,4,5.
* [plot_6.ipynb](./plot_6.ipynb) and [plot_7.ipynb](./plot_7.ipynb) are for generating figure 6 and 7 correspondingly.
* [double_gyre_example.ipynb](./double_gyre_example.ipynb) is for generating figure 8,9,10,11.
