## Overview

This project provides code for generating figures (4 - 13) in the paper [Transfer Operators from Batches of Unpaired Points via Entropic Transport Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08425)

## Getting started
* [Data_567.ipynb](./Data_567.ipynb) and [Data_8.py](./Data_8.py) are used to generate simulated data for the corresponding plots. To save your time, we also provide ready-to-use data: [Data_5.csv](./Data_5.csv), [Data_6.csv](./Data_6.csv), [Data_7.csv](./Data_7.csv), [Data_8.csv](./Data_8.csv).
* [kernel_example.ipynb](./kernel_example.ipynb) is for generating figure 4 and the kernel density plots in figure 5,6,7.
* [plot_line_567.ipynb](./plot_line_567.ipynb) is for generating the line plots in figure 5,6,7.
* [plot_8.ipynb](./plot_8.ipynb) and [plot_9.ipynb](./plot_9.ipynb) are for generating figure 8 and 9 correspondingly.
* [double_gyre_example.ipynb](./double_gyre_example.ipynb) is for generating figure 10,11,12,13.
